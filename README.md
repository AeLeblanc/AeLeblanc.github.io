# dev-portfolio
This is my current live portfolio to host projects on and continue learning. Personalized portfolio coded by me is in progress as I perfect it and keep learning. For now the original code for this portfolio is html5up and is credited within the code documents.

I will be making visible changes to this portfolio on github to document my progress and customized changes.

their readme follows:

Astral by HTML5 UP
html5up.net | @ajlkn
Free for personal and commercial use under the CCA 3.0 license (html5up.net/license)


First of its kind on H5U! Astral features a flat, minimalistic design, a fully animated
interface (with noscript fallbacks), and styling for all basic page elements (including
blockquotes, tables and lists). Enjoy!

you can use for pretty much whatever.

Feedback, bug reports, and comments are not only welcome, but strongly encouraged :)
